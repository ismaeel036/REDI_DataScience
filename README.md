## REDI_DataScience_Project

### Energy Consumption Analysis

### Final Project for Python for Data Science Course

### Concept
•	Energy modelling is based on data analysis
•	For this project, electricity consumption and generation for one year in Germany will be analyzed
•	Analysis should give an insight into nature of energy consumption at different times of a day and period of the year
•	The result can give help in modelling and prediction of future energy systems 

### Dataset and Source
•	Different energy datasets can be gotten from several official sources
•	For this project, two sources are used
•	ENTSO-E: [European Network of Transmission System Operators](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/)
•	SMARD: Strommarktdaten - [The Bundesnetzagentur's electricity market information](https://www.smard.de/en)

### Methodology/Steps
•	Get dataset and extract useful parts
•	Set up notebook and load dataset into project
•	Perform data operations on dataset using Numpy, Pandas…
•	Data visualization using matplotlib, Seaborn…
•	Analyze results and plots
•	Perform basic machine learning operations

### Tools
•	Python
•	Google Colaboratory
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	GitHub
•	Anaconda
